# Birdie
### Why migrations?
Birdie was created because even though MongoDB is incredibly flexible and thus allows you to often forgoe the need to make formal changes to the schema or the data en masse, that simply won't do in my opinion! I don't want to version my data, because that is sloppy, and I don't want to sully my application code with unnecessary logic, and neither should you!

### How does Birdie help?
Enter Birdie, a dead simple database migration tool for MongoDB. Birdie is a no frills (nor thrills) approach to handling database migrations with MongoDB. Unlike many migration libraries, Birdie does not ship with a query builder, rather Birdie gives you access to a MongoDB driver database instance in your migrations, empowering you to write you own migrations with the database driver you already know and love. Birdie's thin API should reassure you that this library will not fall out of compatibility with the MongoDB driver because there are less layers of abstraction to maintain. Then what does this library REALLY do?! Birdie simply manages the state of your migrations for you and helps you automate running them from the command line and programmatically in your NodeJS application.

# Configuration
You can create a `birdie.config.js` file to use in the same directory as the command was issued, or name it something else and use a command line option below to let Birdie know about it (documented below in Usage section).

## Default Configuration

Birdie wants to make your life easier, which is why there are certain default configuration values provided for you. By default:
* Migrations directory is `migrations/`.
* Host is `localhost`
* Username is `''`
* Password is `''`

## Example Configurations

Here's an example `birdie.config.js` which only has one environment:

```
module.exports = {
  migration: 4,
  directory: 'migrations/',
  db: {
    name: 'birdy',
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 27017,
    username: '',
    password: '',
  },
  replica: {},
  mongo: {
    server: {
      poolSize: 10,
      socketOptions: {
        connectTimeoutMS: 3600000,
        keepAlive: 3600000,
        socketTimeoutMS: 3600000
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Here's an example of a multi-environment `birdie.config.js` file PLUS it has replica set configuration:

```
module.exports = {
  migration: 4,
  directory: 'migrations/',
  environments: {
    local: {
      db: {
        name: 'birdy',
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 27017,
        username: '',
        password: '',
      },
      replica: {},
      mongo: {}
    },
    prod: {
      db: {
        name: 'birdy-prod',
        host: 'myp.ro.du.c.t.ion.ip',
        port: 27017,
        username: 'root',
        password: 'lulz',
      },
      replica: {
        host: 'some.other.host', 
        host_port: 27017,
        set: 'rs-food0123'  // Passed to replicaSet GET param in connection string
      },
      mongo: {}
    }
  }
};
```

# Migration Files

Migration files must live in the directory specified by the config, and they must follow the following naming convention: The migration ID should be the first part of the migration filename, separated by the rest of the filename by an underscore. For example `0257_renamed_documents_collection.js`.

Migration files must export two functions, named `up` and `down` respectively. Each of these functions receives three arguments from birdie, (1) mongodb instance (2) a "done" method you must call when you are done with all of your asynchronous operations, and (3) which is optional, a reference to the mongodb library so that you can leverage it for creating new instances of ObjectId, Timestamp, and the like.

Here is an example migration file:

```
module.exports = {
  up: function (db, done) {
    db.createCollection('fiddlesticks').then(function (collection) {
      console.log('Collection was created!');
      done();
    }).catch(function (err) {
      console.log(err);
    });;
  },
  down: function (db, done, mongo) {
    db.collection('fiddlesticks').find({ '_id': new mongo.ObjectId('5845e316b1d13b525517aae4') }).toArray()
      .then(function (res) {
          console.log(`The last words from the fiddlesticks collection: ${res}`);
          db.collection('fiddlesticks').drop(function (err, reply) {
            done();
          });
      });
  }
}
```



# Usage

You can use Birdie's CLI or you can import it as a module and use it in your source code (I recommending every time you boot your app server).

The command `birdie` run in the same directory as a complete `birdie.config.js` file will work.

When running Birdie in your NodeJS application as a module, you invoke it, passing a config object and an optional callback, so simply do something like the following:

```
var migrate = require('birdie');
var config = require('./birdie.config'); // So long as it lives in the same directory

function startTheApp () {
  // The stuff you normally do to boot your application server here
}

migrate(config, startTheApp);

```

If you pass Birdie a callback, it will pass your callback a method which closes the DB connection, which you may choose to invoke if you wish. If you do not pass Birdie a callback, then it will close the db connection automatically after it is done running all migrations.

On top of the configuration file (documented above) and the basic argument-less usage, there are a number of options you can specify at the time of running the birdie command from the command line. For a list of available CLI options `birdie --help`

# Recommended Conventions 

* The `birdie.config.js` file should be tracked in your source control, so that you can associate changes in your database with changes in your source code.
* The changes performed in a single migration's `up` method should perform the exact inverse action as its `down` method, and vice-versa.
* Following the example in the usage section above, you should check to see if any migrations need to be run every time you start your application. This way, we ensure that your schema is compatible with with your source code.
